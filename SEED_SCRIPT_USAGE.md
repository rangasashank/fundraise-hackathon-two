## Verify Data in MongoDB

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh fundraise-hackathon

# Count documents
db.notetakersessions.countDocuments()
db.transcripts.countDocuments()

# View sample meeting
db.notetakersessions.findOne()
db.transcripts.findOne()

# Check date range
db.notetakersessions.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      minDate: { $min: "$joinedAt" },
      maxDate: { $max: "$joinedAt" }
    }
  }
])

# Find meetings with specific issue
db.transcripts.find({
  transcriptText: { $regex: "Education Board Grant", $options: "i" }
}).count()
```

## Sample Transcript Format

```
Program Director Sarah Chen: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's operations meeting. I wanted to start by discussing education board grant rejections. Second rejection, volunteer metrics cited as weak.

Volunteer Coordinator Mike Rodriguez: Yes, this has been ongoing for a while now. We really need to address this before it gets worse. What are our options?

Program Director Sarah Chen: We need to develop an action plan. Let me outline what I think we should do.

Tech Lead Alex Thompson: Before we move on, I wanted to bring up mobile app performance on low-bandwidth. Video training materials won't load for users with poor connectivity.

Sarah Chen: That's a good point. These issues are actually related. We need to consider how they impact each other.

Alex Thompson: I can take the lead on researching solutions. I'll have a proposal ready by next week.

Sarah Chen: Excellent. Let's make sure we document our action items clearly. We should track metrics to measure our improvement.

Sarah Chen: Thank you everyone for your input today. Let's reconvene in two weeks to review progress. Mike Rodriguez, please send out the meeting notes and action items by end of day.

Mike Rodriguez: Will do. Thanks everyone.
```

## Staff Members in Meetings

- **Sarah Chen** - Program Director

- **Alex Thompson** - Tech Lead
- **Priya Patel** - Community Outreach Manager
- **James Wilson** - Grant Writer

## Re-running the Script

The script clears all existing data before seeding, so you can run it multiple times:

```bash
node seed-nonprofit-meetings.js
```

Each run will generate a different set of meetings with randomized:
- Meeting count (40-60)
- Issue combinations
- Attendee selections
- Meeting times
- Transcript variations

## Next Steps

After seeding, you can:

1. **View meetings in frontend**: http://localhost:3000/meetings
2. **Test Cross-Meeting Insight Agent** (when implemented)
3. **Analyze recurring patterns** in MongoDB
4. **Test search and filtering** features

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Cannot find module './dist/models/NotetakerSession'"**
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

**Error: "MONGODB_URI is not defined"**
```bash
# Add to backend/.env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fundraise-hackathon
```

**Error: "MongoServerError: E11000 duplicate key error"**
```bash
# Clear database manually
mongosh fundraise-hackathon --eval "db.notetakersessions.deleteMany({}); db.transcripts.deleteMany({})"
```

## Data Characteristics

- **Temporal Distribution**: Bi-weekly meetings over 2 years (~24 months)
- **Issue Progression**: Issues evolve from "new" ‚Üí "escalating" ‚Üí "critical" ‚Üí "addressing" ‚Üí "improving"
- **Theme Balance**: Each theme (funding, volunteers, technology, outreach) appears in ~25% of meetings
- **Realistic Patterns**: Issues recur 2-5 times with different contexts and severity levels
- **Natural Language**: Transcripts use conversational dialogue with realistic nonprofit scenarios
